description: This is the DHCP subtree. Note that a simple search in this suffix will not reveal much information. The purpose of this suffix is to display dynamic behavior in response to certain combinations of search parameters. Take a look at slapd.conf, subsection ou=dhcp, for a list of the conditions that trigger this behavior. By default, this subtree in slapd.conf is prepared for accesses from ISC DHCP3 LDAP-enabled server, but the same combinations can be triggered manually (and response observed) with ldapsearch.
