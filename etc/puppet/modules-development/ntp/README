:title:NTP

= NTP

Network Time Protocol module.

== Classes

Host classes:

ntp::server:: server with standard configuration
ntp::server::stock:: server with no configuration
ntp::client:: client with standard configuration
ntp::client::stock:: client with no configuration

Internal classes:

ntp::package:: software
ntp::config:: configuration

== Parameters

Required parameters:

ntp_servers (for ntp::client):: array of NTP servers

== Notes

NTP installs +ntp+ software and template ntp.conf.

The obsolete +ntpdate+ is not used -- ntp package is installed to provide both
server and client functionality.

In the default configuration, every ntp installation is technically both
a client and a server, because it is configured to sync from a set of servers
and allows others to sync from it.

However, we differentiate between servers and clients because they need
different servers list -- all clients should sync from local servers,
and all local servers should sync from upstream (Internet) servers.

For an NTP server, ntp.conf already includes a verbatim list of upstream
servers from the pool. (DNS records for the hosts in the pool are periodically
rotated to resolve to different NTP servers).

For an NTP client, the upstream servers in the template file are commented and
ntp_servers array parameter expands to local servers list.

=== Stock classes

Stock classes do not install the configuration, and are as useful as the
default configuration that ships with the package.

A stock client is meaningful if you plan to send the list of NTP servers
via DHCP. The DHCP server should send the following information:

option: ntp-servers one,two,three...

For this to work, client's dhclient needs to request ntp-servers field from
DHCP (currently not done by default, but Ubuntu dhcp3-client
version 3.1.1-5ubuntu8 and above do it -- see
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/+bug/74164).

Requesting ntp-servers field adds no burden to the DHCP client, but if the
DHCP server provides the list, it will have a side effect of restarting
client's ntp on every dhclient run.

== Trivia

NTP is an Internet protocol used to synchronize the clocks of computers to some time
reference. NTP was originally developed by Professor David L. Mills at the University of
Delaware and is one of the oldest Internet protocols still in use (since before 1985).

== TODO

- enable authenticated sync (ntp-keygen et al.); patches welcome.
- support fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum <%= ntp_local_stratum %>
- support disabled classes
