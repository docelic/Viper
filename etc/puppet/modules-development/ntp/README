= Introduction =

NTP configuration consists of installing ntp and template ntp.conf.

A common ntp.conf is used for both servers and clients -- the only
difference is in the servers list, which is taken care of by ERB
templating within the file.

Note that, in the default Debian configuration (and inherited by
our ntp.conf template), every ntp installation is technically both
a client and a server (it syncs from a set of servers, and allows
syncing to it).

However, we do want to differentiate servers and clients, because
we advise against mixing locally- and upstream-synced servers in
the same group. All your clients should sync from local servers,
and all your local servers should sync from upstream (the Internet).

= Server / client =

If a machine is a NTP server, it should be of class ntp::server.
The template file contains a verbatim list of upstream (Internet) servers.

If a machine is a NTP client, it should be of class ntp::client.
The list of local servers comes from parameter ntp_servers.
When module is used with Viper, this param is generated from
ntp/servers Debconf key.

= Stock classes =

Stock classes (ntp::server::stock, ntp::client::stock) do not install
the template ntp.conf, and use the default that comes with the package.

A stock client only makes sense if you plan to send it the list of NTP
servers via DHCP. The DHCP server should send it an
'option: ntp-servers one,two,three' value. For this to work, client's
dhclient needs to request ntp-servers field (currently
not done by default, but Ubuntu dhcp3-client version 3.1.1-5ubuntu8 and above
do it -- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/+bug/74164).

When using Viper, using this method of auto-configuring NTP is suboptimal,
because using DHCP-enabled ntp servers list has a brawback of re-starting
ntp on every dhclient run.

= TODO =

- enable authenticated sync (ntp-keygen et al.); patches welcome.
