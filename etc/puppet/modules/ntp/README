NTP module

Available classes:

  ntp::client
	ntp::client::stock
  ntp::server
	ntp::server::stock

* INTRODUCTION *

NTP configuration consists of installing ntp and template ntp.conf.

A common ntp.conf is used for both servers and clients -- the only
difference is in the servers list, which is taken care of by ERB
templating within the file.

Note that, in the default Debian configuration (and inherited by
our ntp.conf template), every ntp installation is technically both
a client and a server (it syncs from a set of servers, and allows
syncing to it).

However, we do want to differentiate servers and clients, because
we advise against mixing locally- and upstream-synced servers in
the same group. All your clients should sync from local servers,
and all your local servers should sync from upstream (the Internet).

* SERVER / CLIENT *

If a machine is a NTP server, it should be of class ntp::server, and
nothing else should be done. The template file contains a verbatim
list of upstream (Internet) servers.

If a machine is a NTP client, it should be of class ntp::client.
The list of local servers comes from ntp_servers array parameter.
When module is used with Viper, this param is generated from
ntp/servers Debconf key.

* STOCK CLASSES *

Stock classes (ntp::server::stock, ntp::client::stock) do not install
the template ntp.conf, and use the default that comes with the package.

A stock client can automatically update its list of NTP servers if
the DHCP server sends it an 'option: ntp-servers one,two,three' value. For
this to work, client's dhclient needs to request ntp-servers field (currently
not done by default, but Ubuntu dhcp3-client version 3.1.1-5ubuntu8 and above
do it -- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/+bug/74164).

When using Viper, using this method of auto-configuring NTP is suboptimal,
because using DHCP-enabled ntp servers list has a brawback of re-starting
ntp on every dhclient run.

* TODO *

What's left to do in the module is enable authenticated sync
(ntp-keygen et al.); patches welcome.
