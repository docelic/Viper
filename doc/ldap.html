<h1>Viper - Custom Perl backend for use with the OpenLDAP server.<br>
</h1>
LDAP can be enormously successful in configuration management, but its
flat data structure, absence of any kind of dynamic behavior, and heaps
of duplicated data make it a mediocre tool.
<h2>Quick introduction to Viper backend<br>
</h2>
To build on LDAP's great
strengths while solving the deficiencies, a custom Perl-based OpenLDAP
backend has been implemented. It's called Viper.<br>
<br>
A "rapid fire" list of significant new features
includes:
search rewriting (subst), default entries (fallbacks), default
attributes (append), dynamic values, expansion to values of other fields or
files, sub-searching, entry relocation, caching of computed values, smart ADD
and MODIFY handling and server-side Debconf prompting.<br>
<br>
The implemented set of features allows LDAP to act as a powerful
central data store, without any data duplication or need for batch
scripts that would periodically re-generate config files. All data
needs to be added only once, all components contact LDAP on the fly,
and all data served by LDAP is current.<br>
<br>
Having a custom backend also brings one other crucial benefit to the
picture -- the ability to make provisions for existing components and
their use of LDAP (DHCP server, puppet, Debconf) without requiring
modifications to their source code.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick overview of typical components that are accessing LDAP.
If access is not enabled directly, but through an interface script,
script name is also listed.<br>

<br>
<h2>More introduction</h2>
The Viper backend implements regular LDAP functionality and can be used
in general-purpose LDAP scenarios where you want quick results on a
platform that already has extra features (default entries, query
rewriting, dynamic values, etc.), and also lends itself to further
custom functionality.<br>
<br>
However, it's main role is serving as the backend for automatic system
installations and configurations, where the hosts are Debian-based
systems retrieving configuration data using HTTP preseeding, Debconf
and its LDAP driver, and in a final stage Puppet. A whole set of
features has been implemented specifically for this purpose.<br>
<br>
Viper backend has a number of specifics, of course; some are coming to
play in all usage scenarios, and some primarily in automatic install
scenarios.<br>
<h2>Summary of features</h2>
Here's the summary of Viper features, grouped by category:<br>
<h4>General</h4>
Server data is kept in form of LDIF files in the filesystem (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">/var/lib/ldap/viper/</span>), where each
entry is represented by a directory structure (DN components) and a
single file representing the final entry (leaf).&nbsp; It means that
internally, on a low level, you can modify LDAP values like a
filesystem operation (editing files and directories), that you can use
symlinks and hardlinks, and that you can set file permissions to affect
reading and writing.&nbsp; Files have a mandatory suffix, so that they
are distinguishable from their corresponding directories, where the
subentries are kept. Here's an example of disk structure:<br>
<pre>s1:/var/lib/ldap/viper# find .<br>.<br>./ou=dhcp.ldif<br>./ou=dhcp<br>./ou=dhcp/ou=eth1.ldif<br>./ou=dhcp/cn=s1.ldif<br>./ou=clients.ldif<br>./ou=defaults<br>./ou=defaults/ou=hosts<br>./ou=defaults/ou=hosts/cn=netcfg.get_domain.ldif<br>./ou=defaults/ou=hosts/cn=partman.confirm.ldif<br>./ou=defaults/ou=hosts/cn=preseed.early_command.ldif<br>./ou=defaults/ou=hosts/cn=console-keymaps-at.keymap.ldif<br>./ou=defaults/ou=hosts/cn=time.zone.ldif<br><br></pre>
Each file is expected to contain only one entry, and so within each
file, exactly and only the first entry is relevant. Everything in there
that is either another entry or just invalid data (honoring server's
schema), be it after or
within the first entry, is IGNORED.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<h4>Adding entries</h4>
There is a config option available to allow ADD operation to overwrite
existing entries without throwing ALREADY_EXISTS error. See
'addoverwrites'<br>
<br>
There is a config option available to allow ADD operation to ignore
adds on already existing entries without throwing ALREADY_EXISTS
error.&nbsp; Applicable when addoverwrites=false. See 'addignoredups'<br>
<br>
Regarding values normalization, on every ADD we normalize entry DN and
save it that way. It is not possible to retrieve the DN back in the
original form submitted. Attribute values (such as ou=Hosts) are left
as-is and are not modified even if they were normalized within DN.<br>
<br>
(Debconf-specific) When entry is added somewhere under Debconf tree
(configurable via a list of regexes), it is possible to check the list
of entry's variables and see if the entry should be relocated to other
parts of the tree. This is used to move keys from their host-specific
location up the tree to become site-wide or global default. See
'addrelocate'<br>
This functionality is debconf- and client- or server- specific, and
requires that Debconf, running on client or server side, asks the
regular question, and another question about where the answer should be
saved.&nbsp; This relocation information is passed to Viper over
viper_location= variable within the entry. Both server-side prompter
and client-side LDAP-enabled backend and
frontend that implement this described scenario are available.<br>
<h4>Modifying entries</h4>
When a modify request is issued and the specific entry to modify is
there, everything goes on as usual. But if the entry is not exactly
there (i.e.&nbsp; it comes from a fallback), then it's possible to
either return NO_SUCH_OBJECT (as if the entry was not found at all), or
to copy &amp; modify the fallback to the expected name, effectively
creating the target entry in the process. See 'modifycopyonwrite'<br>
<br>
Some of the entry's attributes may actually not be present in the
entry, but come from so-called 'appended values' (see 'Searching'
features below).&nbsp; If a modify request is issued and the
modification is to be performed on an attribute that does really exist,
everything goes on as usual. But if it is one of the appended
attributes, we retrieve its values and add it to the entry as if it was
there all along. Then we let the modify procedure continue, so the
attribute gets copied over, modified, and saved directly into the entry.<br>
<br>
There is a config option available to ignore MODIFY requests which do
not result in a different entry. (Useful with Debconf which treats all
invoked questions as modified, and submits them back to the directory
as modifications, even if their value did not change during the
process).&nbsp; See 'modifysmarts'<br>
<h4>Searching</h4>
When a search is made, it is possible to regex match combination of the
input params (base, scope, deref, size, time, filter, attrOnly), and if
all of them match a specification, then the params can be arbitrarily
rewritten, i.e. you could replace search base with another base if
certain filter is used. See 'searchsubst'<br>
<br>
Search rewriting is completely free-form, and it is possible to rewrite
searches to a completely different suffix, as long as both are located
in the same base directory.<br>
This is a legitimate feature of the rewrite model and is officially
used to rewrite incoming DHCP search queries to appropriate places with
appropriate parameters.<br>
<br>
When a specific search base is requested, and it does not exist in the
searched location, it is possible to fallback to a chain of default
entries.&nbsp; See 'searchfallback'<br>
<br>
When an entry is found (directly or through fallbacks), it can be
appended with attributes from other entries. The default entries to
look up can be specified with the entry's seeAlso attribute, or fixed
in a config file. See 'entryappend'<br>
<br>
When an entry is read, it is possible to cause attribute value
expansion into values of other entries' attributes, such as: "result is
$ exp $ DN ATTR VALX" ===&gt; "result is VALUE". DN is the wished
entry's DN, ATTR is its attribute you want to expand to, and VALX is
either a numerical ID of the value you want, or a string which is used
to join eventual multiple values in a single string (can use " " or \s
for space).&nbsp; Shorthand
notation is also possible: simply ATTR [VALX] implies ATTR in the
current entry, with selected VALX (or ID 0). See 'expandval'<br>
<br>
When an entry is read, it is possible to cause attribute value
expansion into values of a complete, valid sub-search.&nbsp; "find $
BASEDN SCOPE DEREF SIZE TIME FILTER ATTRONLY ATTR VALX GVALX" ===&gt;
"VALUE".&nbsp; All attributes correspond directly to standard LDAP
search parameters.&nbsp; ATTR is the attribute to return.&nbsp; VALX is
either a numerical ID of the value you want, or a string which is used
to join eventual multiple values *of individual entry* in a single
string. GVALX is the same as VALX, but specifying joiner for values *of
different entries* (i.e. valx/gvalx spec of "|" ", " might return
result such as "e1v1|e1v2, e2v1, e3v1|e3v2|e3v3".&nbsp; VALX or GVALX
omitted default to 0 (first value). They can also be \s for whitespace
and \0 for indicating that we want to expand into multiple attribute
values, not join values into a single string. See 'findval'<br>
<br>
When an entry is read, it is possible to cause attribute value
expansion into values of on-disk files, ALWAYS relative to server data
dir, such as: "result is $ file [spec] $ FNAME" ===&gt; "result is
FILE-DATA". [Spec] is optional and when number, specific line number is
returned; when string, a line or $1 matching the regex from the file is
returned; when not present, whole file is returned. See 'fileval'<br>
<br>
When an entry is read, it is possible to cause Perl evaluation of
contents within attributes, such as: "result is $ perl $ 3 + 4" ===&gt;
"result is 7".&nbsp; ** WARNING ** DANGEROUS ** DISABLED BY DEFAULT **.
See 'perleval'<br>
<br>
When entries are returned to the host, each entry will contain a DN
of&nbsp; its actual location on the disk (if the entry is coming from a
fallback, its DN may be something completely different from what was
requested).&nbsp; That's more useful (and easier) than changing the DN
to its would-be value. Experience also shows that the calling programs
do not care about the DN and are not confused by this, so there are no
adverse effects to it.<br>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
All of the above features are tunable from the config file; non-trivial
options do not have a default and so they must be present in the config
file to get configured in the first place, otherwise they effectively
stay disabled.<br>
<br>
Some config directives have short names, but you can call them using
any longer form. For example, directive 'exp' can be, for clarity,
written as 'expand' or 'expandVal'.<br>
<br>
All directives from the config file are registered on the stack. The
stack can be saved to file, loaded from file for processing, or
reset.&nbsp; Saving and loading the stack allows for quicker and less
error-prone approach in repetitive blocks, especially if they repeat
for each suffix you configure. (Different suffixes can load each
other's files as long as they're configured with the same base
directory).&nbsp; 'Clean' can be called on purpose to remove all
on-disk stack files.<br>
<h4>Other</h4>
OpenLDAP locking is such that only one Viper function may be executing
at a time (even if you have multiple Perl suffixes configured, only one
is executing at a time), so no custom locking is necessary. But we
still do manual flocks where necessary to keep things under control and
cover scenarios with multiple LDAP servers in the same tree.<br>
<br>
Viper backend is called from OpenLDAP's back_perl handler, which is
severely limited when it comes to user and access control. If you need
any bind control beyond bind DN and password, or any further access
control, chances are you'll have to extend back_perl.c.<br>
<br>
Using scripts/viper.pl (or anything else that resembles the approach
shown there) allows Viper to run standalone, directly under the Perl
interpreter, yet producing the exact same results as if it was running
under slapd. This feature is best suited for running Viper under perl
profiler or debugger, but can come handy in other slick scenarios.<br>
<br>
Some of the dynamically produced values might take a long time to
compute. Viper supports a generic cache mechanism which allows caching
of any overlay's result, with variable validity period, specified as
time interval, number of accesses, or number of LDAP operations.&nbsp;
Examples for time-based expiry: 5 (implies seconds), 5s, 10m, 2h, 2d,
1w. To specify expiry in number of accesses, use specifier 'u', such as
20u. Note that 20u implies the value will be rebuilt on 20th access,
giving you cached value 19 times. To specify expiry in number of LDAP
operations, use specifier 'o', such as 1o. Expiry setting of 1o is by
far best overall setting that minimizes or eliminates risk of stale
data getting served, while still showing massive performance
improvement (multiple times).&nbsp; See 'overlayconfig'<br>
<br>
Similar to the above, it's also possible to cache LDAP entry reads from
disk. Cache specifications and explanation are the same as we just
discussed, except that the performance gains are modest compared to the
overlay cache (just in the &lt;= 20% range). See 'cacheopen'<br>
