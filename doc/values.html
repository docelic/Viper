<h1>Viper - Modifying or adding configuration values</h1>

The basis of the host setup is the host's LDAP entry, found at 
<i>cn=HOSTNAME,ou=hosts,o=DOM.AIN,ou=clients</i>.

<br><br>
The host entry itself contains a small number of most important
attributes, such as hostname, macAddress, ipHostNumber and the list of
classes the host belongs to. (It also
includes DHCP information, but that data is not important when
considering hosts in the context of suffix <i>ou=clients</i>, and
might be removed in the future).

<h2>Locations for adding configuration values</h2>

The overarching idea of the whole Viper system is to keep all configuration
in one place, making no distinction between Debconf and our own values.

<br><br>
This means we use Debconf format for all configuration, and
we save each config value to some of the three levels:

<ul>
	<li>Host-specific level (i.e. cn=ntp/servers,cn=HOSTNAME,ou=hosts,o=DOM.AIN,ou=clients)
	<li>Site-wide level (i.e. cn=ntp/servers,ou=hosts,ou=defaults,o=DOM.AIN,ou=clients)
	<li>Global level (i.e. cn=ntp/servers,ou=hosts,ou=defaults)
</ul>

(Note that each Debconf question consists of a question and template.
Templates are saved to basically the same places as above, just replacing 
<i>ou=hosts</i> with <i>ou=templates</i>.)

<h2>Accessing configuration values</h2>

Debconf will not mind the added questions at all, but it will not query
them as it doesn't know about them, of course.

<br><br>
So there are a few ways you can take advantage of the configuration
values you add. There are general and Viper-specific approaches.
The general approaches are of
little interest to us, but we list them here for completeness.
The real
interest lies in Viper-specific methods.

<br><br>
General approaches:

<ul>
	<li> Modify Debconf script for a package to query new Debconf values
	<li> Read values from your scripts
</ul>

Viper-specific approaches:

<ul>
	<li> Make the value used during constructing of some other value (i.e. define key client/name, then configure webserver root directory to be /var/www/<i>client_name</i>)

	<li> Flag question with "flags: puppet" to have it automatically appear 
	as Puppet variable which you can use in Puppet manifests, modules and
	ERB templates (i.e. Debconf key ntp/servers, flagged with 'flags: preseed'
	would appear as variable $ntp_servers in manifests and ntp_servers in 
	ERB templates).

</ul>
